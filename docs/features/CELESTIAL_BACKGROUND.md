# Celestial background v1

Layers → Celestial background and Settings → Globe toggle a NASA-source Milky Way
backdrop behind Earth. It is disabled by default; enable it explicitly to use the backdrop. Loading or decoding failure
retains the previous procedural starfield with an English diagnostic/retry in
Settings. Turning it off restores the original rendering path and fixtures.
Earth imagery, shading, occlusion and tile requests stay unchanged.

The bundled 4096×2048 asset is the **celestial diffuse Milky Way** from
[NASA Deep Star Maps 2020, SVS 4851](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851/), without its
bright Hipparcos/Tycho foreground. No additional procedural stars are painted over
it. This slice is directional imagery, not a selectable star catalog, deep-sky
search, HiPS survey or a physically navigable universe.

`assets/sky/manifest.json` pins source and derivative SHA-256 values, release,
credit, map convention, usage assessment and offline preparation. The 2.5 MB JPEG
is a fixed-exposure Reinhard/sRGB **SDR derivative**, not HDR-equivalent fidelity.
The original EXR stays upstream; `scripts/prepare_sky.py` verifies it and prepares
the asset offline with FFmpeg/Python. No runtime download or EXR parser is needed.
The NASA/Gaia credit is visible on the globe and in Settings; a submitted screenshot
captures the displayed frame's credit in PNG Source metadata without copying the
shared framebuffer or drawing UI over the clean image.

Core converts Earth-fixed rays to ICRF/J2000 directions with sofars 0.6.1's IAU
2006/2000A bias/precession/nutation/rotation model. TT uses its UTC leap table;
UT1 is approximated by UTC and polar motion is zero. This is suitable for a
4K visual backdrop, not precision astrometry. Current wall-clock time is sampled
in minute buckets; a time simulator is not introduced. Opposite Earth longitudes
and changing time affect the frame transform rather than arbitrarily rotating a
camera-local texture. RA 0h is centered, RA increases leftward, north is up;
bilinear longitude wrapping and pole clamping prevent the usual mirror/seam bugs.
SOFA/sofars notices are included and readable in Settings → Globe.

Realistic mode fades faint sky near the daytime surface between solar altitudes
−18° and −6°, returning to full visibility by 100 km altitude. **Cinematic sky**
explicitly bypasses this attenuation. This is a simple visibility policy, not a
new atmospheric scattering model. Existing atmosphere still composites in front.

Data decodes one optional image on its bounded CPU service and wakes the UI on
success/failure. Encoded input is limited to 8 MiB; decoded dimensions are fixed
and decoder allocation is limited to 64 MiB. One shared RGB image retains 24 MiB;
transient decoder allocations and compressed binary bytes are additional. Sky
assets do not enter imagery MBTiles or its 128 MiB disk target.

Render samples on CPU; experimental GPU rendering uses the same exact CPU sky
repair after readback. No GPU sky texture/upload or device-specific compression
is required. Sky/cinematic/clock keys reject stale presentation results. CPU
fallback/device-loss behavior is retained. This is not a claim that every GPU or
packaged platform has been physically tested.

Tests cover the SOFA orientation reference, RA handedness, seams/poles, time
rotation, daylight/cinematic visibility, bounded async asset decode/wake,
preference persistence, screenshot credit snapshots, original fixtures and
unchanged Earth pixels/missing-tile priorities. The explicit native-GPU parity
check also includes the real sky when enabled. See CONTRIBUTING.md for matched
camera, toggle and platform visual checks. Higher-resolution assets, HDR/mip
quality profiles, catalogs, constellation guides and Sky/Space Explorer are later
slices from the planning pack.
